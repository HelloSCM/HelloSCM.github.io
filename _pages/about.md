<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am Chenming SHANG (Â∞öËæ∞Èì≠). I am currently a master student (2nd year) in [Intelligent Interaction Group (IIG)](https://sites.google.com/view/iigroup-thu/home), Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. [Yujiu Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4gH3sxsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my bachelor's degree in Intelligent Science and Technology from Sun Yat-sen University in 2022, advised by Prof. [Zhi Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v70dNBoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

My research interests lie in **cognitive science-inspired AI** and **trustworthy AI**, including **interpretability** and **generalization**. The research topics I am currently interested in are compositional generalization, concept-based models, and causal inference. I hope to make AI spontaneously summarize concepts from data as human does, enabling the infinite combination of finite concepts to achieve generalization in unknown scenarios.

Now I am looking for an intern or a research assistant position, and I also have plans to pursue a Ph.D. position. If you are willing to offer cooperation opportunities, please feel free to contact me.

**Incremental Residual Concept Bottleneck Models**

`Chenming Shang`, Shiji Zhou, Hengyuan Zhang, Xinzhe Ni, Yujiu Yang, Yuwang Wang 

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08978) | [[Code]](https://github.com/HelloSCM/Res-CBM)
- Our work primarily addresses the challenges of completeness, purity and precision in previous methods.
- We utilize the multimodal model CLIP to extract and discover concepts, and design interpretable classification model to enhance the interpretability and few-shot generalization ability of the algorithm.
- We propose the Incremental Residual Concept Bottleneck Models (Res-CBM) to address the challenge of concept completeness and the Concept Utilization Efficiency (CUE) metric to measure the descriptive efficiency of CBMs.

**Understanding Multimodal Deep Neural Networks: A Concept Selection View**

`Chenming Shang`, Hengyuan Zhang, Hao Wen, Yujiu Yang

[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08964) | [Code]
- We observe the long-tail distribution of concepts, based on which we propose a two-stage Concept Selection Model (CSM) to mine core concepts without introducing any human priors.
- The concept greedy rough selection algorithm is applied to extract head concepts, and then the concept mask fine selection method performs the extraction of core concepts.

**GeoCon: Compositional Generalization Through Geometric Constraints on Representation Structure**

`Chenming Shang`, Shiji Zhou, Hengyuan Zhang, Xinchen Zhang, Lei Ke, Yuwang Wang, Yujiu Yang 
- We establish a quantitative relationship between Parallelism Score (PS) in cognitive neuroscience and the compositional generalization (CG) ability of model representations.
- To optimize the CG performance theoretically, we propose the incorporation of two regularization techniques, Parallelism Score Maximization and Distance Variance Minimization, to enhance the model CG ability.

Hengyuan Zhang, `Chenming Shang`, Sizhe Wang, Dongdong Zhang, Feng Yao, Renliang Sun, Yiyao Yu, Yujiu Yang, Furu Wei

[Paper]
- Based on the singular value decomposition, we define the language subspace.
- We then transfer the non‚Äëdominant language space to the dominant language space through shift projection and leverage contrastive learning to further alignment.
- The non‚Äëdominant language can access richer information from the parameters of LLMs and improve comprehension capability.
